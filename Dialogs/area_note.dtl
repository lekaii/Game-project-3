On a dusty shelf, you find a folded letter with shaky handwriting\:
"They found out I tried to escape. The others are already gone. I hear the dragging sounds outside my door. But I saw him. The manager. 
He didn’t use the front door. He touched the frame of the hotel painting in his office… and then he disappeared."
player: Office? They must mean the safe room...
set {paintingkey} = "true"
